Sample application to search a string and find the occurence of the given URL in search engine result page.
Searchengine.json is a option to configure the different search engines. There are some specific querystring parameters for each search engine to search a string and 
to define the number of search results returned from the search engine.
I have created a basic UI without much styling to verify the results- For ex: the autocomplete used in the page does not display the dropdown correctly. 
So once we type in a search engine name it will display the available search engine matching the text right below the input box. Please click on the list item before submitting.
